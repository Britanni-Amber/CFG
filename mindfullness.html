    <h3>Mindfull eating</h3>
        <p>
            How often do you scarf down a meal before running to class or mindlessly eat while you’re in front of the TV? 
            Change it up, girl!
        </p>
        <p>
            Try being mindful when you’re eating. Slow down and really taste each bite. 
            Have a moment of admiration for the beautiful meal in front of you. 
            You’ll get so much more out of mealtime this way!
        </p>
        <p>
            If mindful eating is hard for you, it can be helpful to take a few minutes after you eat to make notes on your meal.
             Don’t just write down the basics, like what you ate and the nutrient breakdown, but also note how it made you feel. 
             You might learn more about healthy food options that make you super happy! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Quality, nutritious food choices can go a long way in impacting both your physical and mental wellbeing. 
            A better diet = a healthier lifestyle = better mental health!
        </p>

    <h3>Mindful listening</h3>
    <br>
        <p>
            Okay, I know we all struggle with this. 
            But of all the mindfulness activities, this is the one that will make the biggest 
            difference for the people you care most about.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here’s what I do: if I’m going to meet up with a friend but I know my brain is going a mile a minute,
             I carve out a few minutes to sit with my notebook or #GOALS Planner. 
             I make notes about stuff I don’t want to forget and put stuff on my calendar to deal with later.
            That way, when I show up with my friend, I can be totally, 100% present with her.
            I can tune into everything she’s saying and really enjoy the time with her.
            And I think it makes the hangout sesh better for both of us! 
        </p>

    <h3>Mindful meditation</h3>
        <p>
            Meditation is one of those ideas of mindfulness that can feel really intimidating 
            if you’re not sure where to start. But meditating helps to slash stress and increase
            your self-awareness, plus it makes you feel better. And it can even make you more creative and patient!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My top tips to make meditation feel way easier are:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li> Start with ten minutes a day. Seriously, you can do anything for ten minutes!
            Roll out your Yoga Mat and try carving out this little bit of time in your schedule for a week and see how you feel.</li>
        <li> Use guided meditations. Just sitting there can be tricky if you haven’t figured out how to quiet and calm your brain.
             I love using guided meditations to help me hold this space for myself. 
             There are a bunch on YouTube and Spotify (you can even type in “10 minute guided meditation”) or you can try an app.</li>
