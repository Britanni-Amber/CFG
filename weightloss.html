            <h2>Truth about weightloss</h2>
            <br>
            <article>
            <p>
                Weight loss is actually really pretty straightforward.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It comes down to moving your body more and fueling it with the right foods to build muscle, burn fat and improve your overall health.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Again, if you want to lose weight and ACTUALLY KEEP IT OFF, you should aim to only lose about 1-2 pounds per week.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In my meal plans I like to focus on “adding to my plate.” Add all the veggies and all the protein!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the best ways to help your body burn fat is by increasing your protein intake
                <br>
                I recommend you get at least 20g of protein with each meal – that’s roughly the size of your palm.

            <h2>How sleep impacts your weightloss</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lesser known weight loss fact? You also need to make it a priority to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you get enough sleep you will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Crave less junk
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Consumer less overall
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Burn more calories
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                Focus on loving your body. When you show your body love you….
                <br>
                Make time for your workouts. Make time to eat healthy meals. Make time to rest and recover.
                <br>
                You will never regret a single one of those choices and you’ll see SERIOUS change if you do!
