    <h2>1. Try something new!</h2>
    <br>
    <article>
    <p>
        Sounds easy enough, but trying something new (or again) can be super intimidating. I had a lot of fear from past “failures” that
        made me feel like I couldn’t do it. The idea of losing 10lbs seemed impossible let alone 45lbs! But I did. I had to acknowledge 
        the fear, accept the discomfort, and do it anyway! The amazing thing is, when you challenge yourself to do something and 
        actually do it completing transforms your mind.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Accomplishing a small goal, even something as simple as holding a 10 second plank or going for a 5 minute walk every day, 
        will give you a dose of instant motivation!

    <h2>2. Find some real inspiration!</h2>
    <p>
        Don’t get me wrong, girls who have been fit their whole lives are super inspiring, but seeing women who have struggled with 
        weight transform their bodies is remarkable. For me, the girls in the magazines bodies (now tik tok, ig, etc.) didn’t seem 
        attainable. Granted, I didn’t know their stories, but my assumption at the time was that they had always been thin.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I had to find some real inspo and at the time I didn’t know that existed so I had my mom snap some pictures of me and 
        I used that those to inspire me. Not because I had done anything yet, but because looking at photos of my body at that 
        point was painful. I knew the mental and emotional pain I felt in that moment and I never wanted to feel that way again.

    <h2>3. Connect with other women!</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Did you know there is an incredible community of women just waiting to encourage you? Team LSF is our Love Sweat Fitness 
        community of women who come together to support one another through this journey. We are here as a safe space for ALL women 
        to come and let down their walls and help build each other up. To be raw, honest, and vulnerable with one another about some 
        of our deepest insecurities. No judgement, just LOTS of love for you!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Accountability and support is truly the key to creating a lifestyle that lasts! We don’t always have people at home that full 
        understand WHY we are making changes. Often times, even with the best intentions, they discourage us from making healthy choices 
        because it doesn’t quite fit what they’re comfortable with. But this journey is YOURS! You need to connect with women who get it 
        and get you so you can build the strength and confidence you deserve!
